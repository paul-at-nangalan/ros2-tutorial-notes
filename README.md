# ros2-tutorial-notes
My notes and code from following the ros2 tutorial here:
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble

I mainly focused on C++ where there were both Python and C++.

There seem to be some paid courses out there, but I found these free tutorials very helpful and recommend anyone trying to learn ROS2 starts with these.
